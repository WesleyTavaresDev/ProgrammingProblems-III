# ProgrammingProblems-III

*Java Conditional Statement*

        • 1. Write a Java program to get a number from the user and print whether it is positive or negative.
        
        • 2. Take three numbers from the user and print the greatest number.

*Java arrays*
                
        • 1. Write a Java program to sum values of an array.
        • 2. Write a Java program to calculate the average value of array elements. 
        • 3. Write a Java program to test if an array contains a specific value. 

*Object-Oriented Programming (oop)*
1. Print the average of three numbers entered by user by creating a class named 'Average'
having a method to calculate and print the average.
2. Create the Person class with the following characteristics:

        • attributes: age and day, month and year of birth, person's name

        • methods:
        
            the calculateAge(), which receives the current date in days, month and years and calculates and stores the person's current age in the age attribute

            the infoAge(), which returns the value of the age

            informName(), which returns the person's name

        • Create two objects of the Person class, one representing Albert Einstein (born on 3/14/1879) and the other representing Isaac Newton (born 1/4/1643)
        
        • Make a main class that instantiates the objects, initializes them and shows which ones would be the ages of Einstein and Newton if they were alive.

3. *Make a program with following characteristics:*

        • A class called University that will have a name as an attribute and will have a
        method to enter your name.

    
        • Relate the Person class to the University class. Each person can
        be associated with a University.

        • The Person class, in turn, will have a method that will say its name and in which
        university works.

4. *Create a class to represent a football player:* 
        
        • Attributes:
        
                • Name, position, date of birth, nationality, height and weight.

        • Public methods:

                • Sets and gets;

                • A method to print all player data;

                • A method to calculate the age of the player;

                • A method to show how much time is left for the player to retire. For this, consider that players in the defensive position retire on average at 40, midfield players at 38 and attackers at 35.
